How to install the .deb 



- ``sudo apt-get install p7zip-full`` 
- ``7z e first.7z`` for example (a bit slow so be patient as it has a very high compression ratio - lossless too
- ``sudo apt install ./*.deb``



first.7z - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jzu_sK604-cTo20HhDunQLTtDXgbdoZx/view?usp=sharing - compiled for the https://www.asacomputers.com/Cavium-ThunderX-ARM-dup.html?mode=spec so might not work on the raspberry pi

second.7z - I am cross compiling it - available soon!
